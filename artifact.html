  <h1>Artifact</h1>
  <h2>Phase 1 <br> Find and Print a Thingiverse Artifact</h2>

  <p>The <b>Lion Dance</b> is a traditional dance originating in Chinese culture and embraced by several other Asian countries (i.e. Vietname, Japan, Jorea, Tibet), where dance performers wear a lion costume and mimic a lion's movement as an act of bringing good luck, fortune, and ward off evil spirits. Typically, the costume is in colors that symbolize riches and fortune. </p>

  <p>I chose this specific modern artifact because it is a large part of my Vietnamese culture and something I've always embraced and looked forward to during the Vietnamese New Year. There are two lion dances: Chinese Northern Lion and the Chinese Souther Lion. The specific lion dance shown in the video and seen frequently in the Bay Area is the Chinese Southern Lion Dance, known for its adoption of kung fu moves and postures to aid its movement and stances. It heavily embraces the richness of expression and appearance, complex footwork, and strong, roaring drumming to create a memorable performance for all.</p>

  <h2>Phase 2 <br> The Artifact & Story: <b> Project Outline </b></h2>

  Idea 1: (Eddson Jose) What if humans gave colonized Mars?
  <li>Special clothing for body adjustments?</li>
  <li> Human physiology change? Taller/thinner anatomy? </li>
  <li>Large varieties of potatoes</li>
  <li>Teleportation devices allowing transportation from Earth to Mars </li>
  <li>Cloud Purifier Water Condenser (CPWC)</li><br>

  Idea 2: (Jason Manzon) What if the sea levels rose and the entire world is engulfed in water?
  <li>Advanced Water Vehicles (cars, bikes, skateboards)</li>
  <li>Humans would evolve gills/webbed feet/etc. → homo aquaticus</li>
  <li>Underwater cities</li>
  <li>Humans develop an implanted computer chip with new sonar language systems (communication underwater)</li>
  <li>Evolved Land animals (Evolving into a water animal form) </li>
  <li>Relationship with sea life</li>
  <li>Bigger fish eat humans oof different food chain?</li>
  <li>More discovery of the sea floor</li><br>

  Idea 3: (Benjamin Norman) What if we see people’s actual souls through their eyes?
  <li>Glasses/Goggles to see into people’s soul</li>
  <li>The equipment will strain your eyes to blindness to where you need to take medication (eye drops or pills) </li>
  <li>Sunglasses that block ‘soul vision’ </li>
  <li>Cult for the pure and another for the dark </li>
  <li>Drugs that disguise your purity of your soul</li>
  <li>Blind people aren’t registered with soul identity (middle) </li>
  <li>Soul Containers (Made by Soul Snatcher on for the Dark, results lead to people being blind or soulless)</li><br>

  Idea 4: (Vanessa Rivera) What if the North Pole and South Pole switch?
  <li>Santa will be on the South Pole (jk, but not really) </li>
  <li>Human’s will have to create a advanced man-made magnetic field because of polar flip</li>
  <li>Birds and other animals that rely on magnetic field will migrate in opposite directions</li>
  <li>Special Umbrellas/ Clothing Materials to protect from space radiation</li>
  <li>Continents may be set differently</li>
  <li>Compasses would have to be altered</li><br>



  <h2>Phase 3 <br> Rough Images & Story </h2>
  <h4>Idea 2 | Rough Images <br>What if the sea levels rose and the entire world is engulfed in water?</h4>
  <img src="Images/artifact_watercam.jpg" alt="Under Water Search Camera/Vehicle" class= "center">
  <p>For my first sketch for Idea 2 was a underwater camera, that could either be self-controlled, controlled, or tagged along with. This could be a vehicle that acts as a police force or search force to seek for items, underwater beings, etc. The vehicle is designed to be dark and small as to not be extremely noticeable nor scare when searching for items/beings. It has it's own light source to search in dark uderwater areas.  </p>

  <img src="Images/artifact_waterveh.jpg" alt="Underwater Vehicle" class= "center">
  <p>My second sketch for Idea 2 was an Underwater Vehicle as a mode of transportation. This vehicle was inspired by aquatic species to have killer whale and dolphin like qualities. This allows for more efficient and easy gliding while traveling in the depths of water. It is built with a waterproof engine that can be started with the turn of the handle (like a motorcycle). It is only capable of holding 1 individual </p>

  <h4>Idea 3 | Rough Images <br> What if we see people’s actual souls through their eyes?</h4>

  <img src="Images/artifact_facemask.jpg" alt="Face Gear" class= "center">
  <p>My first sketch of Idea 3 are some examples of face asks I was experimenting with. I wanted these masks to represent the "Puritan" group of our "Soul World" during the 3057 Soul Purge War. They are in charge of protecting the souls of their universe from the "Dark" Cult. The "Dark" Cult scout and steal the purest souls to use for energy and dark pratcies and the Puritans must try to save these captured souls.</p>
  <img src="Images/artifact_goggles.jpg" alt="Soul Goggles" class= "center">
  <p>These goggles are an advanced technology that can see the souls of other individuals. It allows to see the purity of other's souls.</p><br><br><br>


  After a final discussion, we decided to work as a group and revolve our project around <b>Idea 3 by Benjamin Norman </b> → "What if we see people’s actual souls through their eyes?"


  <h2>Phase 4 <br> Model & Story</h2>

  <p>This is the modeled mask representative of the "Puritans" from the 1st Soul Purge War of our <i>Soul Vision</i> universe. Their mask consists of rare soul stones that allow them to see the purity/impurity of individual's souls for long periods of time without visual damage. The mask sits directly on their eyes, snug on the front of their face. The Puritan group is in search of souls that have been snatched by the "Dark" Cult. </p>
