  <h2>Laser Cutting</h2>
  <h4>Trial 1</h4>
  <h5>AI File: All Pieces</h5>
  <img src="Images/AllPieces_AI.jpg" alt="All Fasteners Trial 1 AI File" style="width:100%">
  <p>Some pros of our Fasteners are the stability and guarantee of security. If all slots are consistent in size, then most pieces are able to fasten with one another allowing for more variety. Some cons of the fastener design could be that it only allows for one way of putting objects on: being that whatever is tabbed through will only be standing upwards. In terms of overall design, this could result in less options of modularity. </p>

  <h5>Laser Printed on Foam Board: All Pieces</h5>

  <h5>Failed Pieces/Fasteners</h5>
  <p>The failed fasteners were incorrectly measured and some tabs did not stick or stand on top another as one thought. These designs were discarded and redone as tabs and slots.</p>

  <h5>Successful Pieces/Fasteners</h5>
  <p>In the sucessful pieces, slots were the all around go to that worked consistently. Pieces stayed snug with one another and were not wobbly.</p>

  <h4>Trial 2</h4>
  <p>The successful fasteners of Trial 1 were kept. However, 2 important major changes we made in this trial were: (1) we decided to add slots to a majority of the pieces to allow for more mobility and modularity and (2) making the inside of the slots slightly more narrow, to allow for a more secrue fit when locked onto another piece.</p>

  <h6>Vanessa's (Left) & Erika's (Right) Pieces</h6>
  <p>For example, in my pieces and Erika's, many of our pieces have various slots that allow them to slide in or onto any other piece if need be. This would allow more ease with building, especially upwards. </p>

  <h6>Group Assembly</h6>
  <img src="Images/assemble_ex.jpg" alt="Example of How Fasteners Build" style="width:100%">
  <p>As you can see, I feel the combination of slots and tabs, allow for much more variability and ease. Slots allowed easy building, while tabs allowed for creating a stronger more structured foundation to build on.</p>

  <h4>Group Schema</h4>
  <img src="Images/cheeseball_schema(JPG).jpg" alt="Group Schema" style="width:100%" >
  <p>Our schema is just to show some possible ideas of where certain tabs and slots go, to give our audience a general idea of how they could begin building and generally how the pieces would work. However, even more results can be done with the pieces than the options shown in our shcema! </p>

  <h4>Artist Statement/Group Contribution & What Was Successful</h4>
  <p>The initial inspiration for this project was revolved around modular architecture and what we imagined would be the idea of building that would have no particular guide, except building from any direction as one pleases. Our professor, Steve Durie, suggested and mentioned how the idea reminded him of favelas in Brazil which we thought fit perfectly with what we wanted to attempt. You would think since we wanted freedom of building and freedom of assembly, making any kind of pieces would work...However, this freedom still has a sort of structure to it. It wasn't easy since our pieces still needed to have suitable fasteners, slots, tabs, and joint measurements. Therefore, there was constant redesigning of pieces to provide the proper connections for all other pieces in our group. </p>

      Erika
      <li>her own fastener designs (1/4 of total group's pieces)</li>
      <li>set and organized AI finals before final cutting</li>
      <li>was on top of taking images and videos for documentation and video editing</li>
      <li>made majority of schema</li>

      <br>Adrian
      <li>his own fastener designs (1/4 of total group's pieces)</li>
      <li>attending on campus meetings for cutting fastners</li>
      <li>took images for documentation</li>

    </ul>
     <br> <p>One major success I found was when we decided to make more slots in our 2nd trial. This really helped us create more variability with how the structure would come out in terms of overall shape. This helped to reduce too much of a boxy structure and to allow the building to be done wherever the user pleases. Another success was definitely the painting process of the pieces and giving them more color. Initially, I didn't think it'd be a big deal to color them, since an entire wooden architectural structure, would also be fitting and minimalistic. However, once everything was painted, we ended up loving it more as it mimiced the bright colors symbolic to Mexican culture. Although, favelas in Brazil was our initial inspiration, we resulted in the colorful houses in Mexico or as David (and some class members) noted, mimiced the houses depicted in the movie <i>Coco</i>.  </p>

  <h4>My Contributions</h4>
  <p>My contributions for this project consisted of:
    <ul>
      <li>coming up with overall idea/concept for the project</li>
      <li>my own fastener desgins (56 pieces; about a bit over 1/4 of total group pieces)</li>
      <li>set up AI files and organize pieces before final cutting</li>
      <li>drop off materials</li>
      <li>pick up pieces & attended every on campus meeting</li>
      <li>provide materials: foamboard for trials and paints</li>
      <li>painting 1/2 of the group's pieces</li>
      <li>did majority of the assembling of pieces during David's filming</li>
      <li>took some extra pictures for myself and group documentation</li>
      <li>contribution to schema and instructions</li>
    </ul>


  <h4>What Could Be Improved?</h4>
  <p> The initial communication between the group felt very difficult. Some members participated, communicated and worked on their portions of the project more than others. Overall, communication was the strongest factor that diminished our end result. I feel if things were done more timely and communicated more thoroughly, results could be even better, but we somehow managed and that's totally okay! I do wish some group members put more of their own design on their pieces, but overall, things did end up coming out well and we were all pleasantly surprised with the end result. :)

    <!-- A couple members rarely, and almost never participated in Zoom class time or group time during Zoom break out rooms. Myself and one member (I am purposely not mentioning the names) were typically the only ones communicating to one another and finishing portions of the project on time. The other two members would plagiarize my work and would barely work on or finish their portion of the assignment during class time, when they should have had it done before class began. I struggled, lost patience, and lost time trying to get the group to contribute more and on a timely manner, and it didn't take until my professor's confrontation and 2 weeks prior to the deadline of this project for those two members to change their work ethics. Overall, communication was the strongest factor that diminished our end result. I feel if things were done more timely and communicated more thoroughly, result could be even better, but we somehow managed. I do wish some group members put more of their own design on their pieces, but overall, things did end up coming out well. </p> -->
