  <h1>Mod & Tessele | Modularity, Tesselation, & Complexity</h1>
  <h2>Phase 1 | First Pass</h2>

  <h3>2D Tesselations & Modification</h3>

    <img src="Images/vr_2Dtess_sq.jpg" alt="Origami Petra Star" style="width:34%">

    <p>I wanted to create a random tesseltation using the triangular tesselation model technique. Being able to play around with the pieces in different ways really allows me to understand the notion of modularity and what a tesselation incorporates mathematically. </p>


  <h3>Origami Modules | Petra Star Pattern & Modification </h3>

    <img src="Images/vr_origami(2).jpg" alt="Origami Petra Star Modified" style="width:40%">

    <p>The approach I took for the modification of the Origami Petra Star was to simply explore what was possible. Some pieces I foled slightly differently to offer different slot options and more outcomes of what could connect. It was quite interesting to see the formation of squares form but this oe piece would struggle to complete it, therefore leaving it open and hanging from the side.</p>




  <h2>Phase 1 | Second Pass</h2>
  <p>Create a simple shared design using illustrator to create a shared shape that will fit and lock. You can make it 3 or more sides. However, ONE SIDE should be a shared standard in the group. As a group create the shapes and then make a pdf design demo, that shows several copies of each persons design, and how you can place them close togather and how they fit togather. Label each one and share who made what in the document</p>
  <h3>Tesselation Modulariy Design & Modification </h3>
  <img src="Images/Fasteners.jpg" alt="Fasteners" class="center">
  <p>The common shape I used was a rhombus/diamond, where for fun I decided to create another shape where I'd split the diamond into two triangles. Therefore, I could vary my options where the common shape of the diamond is still maintained through the two triangles when they are combined with one another (Geometric shapes creating more shapes again) </p>
  <p>The common fastener I decided to incorporate was two stars one one side, with one going in and one going out. I used this common fastner on each shape that creates a diamond (whether it be original or cohesive) and the fun begins when I explore the other sides. The trick was making sure each would be able to connect with one another even with varying fasteners. The easiest way for me to achieve this was to work with a shape one by one. Once one shape was finished, I would base my next shape on my first shape. Ex. Shape B is based on Shape A and Shape C is based on Shape B and/or A and so forth. This allowed confidence that each would certainly work with the other.</p>

  <p>The cohesiveness of the fasteners is shown on the Left Image. Each perfectly fit with one another and it was rather satisfactory. BUT......the chanllenge was in finding a different way to organize them. This took me quite some time, but the best way I was able to find a second trial of cohesiveness was through mirroring the shapes which would help vary the bonds and overall design. Once I was able to find the perfect fit, I was able to create a design I liked even more as shown on the Right Image.</p>

  <h2>Phase 2</h2>
  <h3>Kirigami Model & Fastener</h3>
  <img src="Images/vr_kirigami.jpg" alt="Kirigami Rhombic Polyhedron" style="width:44%">
  <img src="Images/vr_kirigami(2).jpg" alt="Kirigami Rhombic Polyhedron" style="width:55%">
  <img src="Images/vr_kirigami_outline.jpg" alt="Kirigami Rhombic Polyhedron" style="width:40%" class="center">

  <p>My inspiration came from a Rhombic Polyhedron and the process to create this overall tesselated shape was to put the slot of the longer side into the slot of the shorter side. Every piece I cut by hand and I would continue the assembly process until it'd eventually begin to round itself out. This gave me an understanding of how geometric shapes can create more geometric shapes almost infinitely. It turned out very pretty and I really enjoyed keeping this in my room! Maybe add some lights into it and it could be its own little lantern? Who knows</p>

  <h2>Phase 3</h2>
  <h3>Goldilocks Laser Tests: Initial Designs Tests for Fasteners</h3>
  <h4>Test #1</h4>
  <p>Our first round of Fastener Trials were done on foamboard. Several complications came with this in terms of the material burning, as well as the material not being able to withhold small slots. Sometimes because the slot was so close to the edge, the small gap of foamboard would snap out of fragility. </p>

  <h5>AI File: All Pieces</h5>
  <img src="Images/AllPieces_AI.jpg" alt="All Fastener Trials on AI" style="width:100%">
  <p>Some pros of our Fasteners are the stability and guarantee of security. If all slots are consistent in size, then most pieces are able to fasten with one another allowing for more variety. Some cons of the fastener design could be that it only allows for one way of putting objects on: being that whatever is tabbed through will only be standing upwards. In terms of overall design, this could result in less options of modularity. </p>

  <h5>Failed Pieces/Fasteners</h5>
  <p>The failed fasteners were incorrectly measured and some tabs did not stick or stand on top another as one thought. These designs were discarded and redone as tabs and slots.</p>

  <h5>Successful Pieces/Fasteners</h5>
  <p>In the sucessful pieces, slots were the all around go to that worked consistently. Pieces stayed snug with one another and were not wobbly.</p>

  <h4>Test #2</h4>
  <p>For a second trail run of pieces and fastener options, we were advised to change our material to wood. We kept the same design that were successful fasteners: tabs and slots and had them laser cut.</p>

  <h5>AI File of Trial 2: All Pieces</h5>

  <h5>Rough Draft Schema</h5>
  <p>This is just a rough draft simple schema of understanding the structure of the pieces as well as the pieces as a whole through a 2D demonstraction.</p>

  <h5>Trial 2 | Laser Printed on Ply Wood: All Pieces</h5>
  <p>After receiving all laser cut pieces, there was already a noticibly significant difference in the solidity and firmness of the pieces. I didn't feel the need to be extremely cautious that they'd break compared to the foamboard pieces. The fasteners were much more sturdy, however, they could be a bit tighter. Because of the switch in material, wood does not have as much friction nor flexibility for error as foamboard, hence why the noticiability of mistakes is higher. Therefore, some sides may need to be tapered in just slighty (using the direct selection tool on AI). </p>
