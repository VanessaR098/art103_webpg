  <h4>Q1. -- What are the differences between site specific art work and the idea of art interventions.<br>
  Q2. -- What are the similarities and differences regarding the work of Walter De Maria and Banksy? include your thoughts of on their idea of site specificness and interventions<br>
  Q3. -- What are some of the most common creative tactics that all the 'signs' must shares? What must sign have to remain relevant? We are talking about signs that both in the practical context as well as signs that function as art.<br>
  Q4. -- What Kind of art, not shown here, have you seen that was made in response to its location, its environment, a specific event or situation. Please elaborate on its description, provide images if possible.<br>

<h5>Question 1</h5>
<p><b><u>Site specific art</u></b> is art created in a specific local. Location is the primary focus of this type of art, where the work is united and in relationship with its environment. A bit differently, <b><u>art interventions</u></b> are works/art designed specifically in relation to an already existing environment, structure/domain, and/or audience. In other words, site specific is the notion of having a particular space in mind to display one’s work, while the other uses an existing venue.</p>

<h5>Question 2</h5>
<p>I believe some strong similarities of both artists’ works is the idea that they bring attention to the changing perceptions of time and space. In Walter de Maria’s, <i>Lightning Field</i>, by placing the poles outside as opposed to a gallery space allows him to call attention to the importance of its setting and its surroundings. Similarly, Banksy also uses the streets as his canvas. He entices the everyday areas of life to capture his intentions and relay it to his audience, which draws attention and reforms everyday perceptions. However, the major differences definitely remain in the message of their pieces. I believe Walter De Maria’s intent is to transform and draw focus on land in space and time while Banksy likes to focus on the ironies and hypocrisies that exist in our space and time. This is highly evident in Banksy’s <i>Dismaland</i> as he draws his audience back into reality while shining light on Disneyland’s world of escapism that’s achieved through hyperreal simulations, which make our imaginations more real than our realities.

<h5>Question 3</h5>
<p>Some of the most common yet creative tactics all signs have is a solid background color and the content within it, whether it be an image or text, to be bold and in high contrast with the background color. This allows for boldness that draws quick, if not immediate attention from those who see it. Another factor that makes a sign relevant is its shape. Typically all signs use a symmetrical polygon shape and this tends to be a common factor for all signs. By doing this and making this commonaily almost universal, it allows for easier recognition for its audience...therefore one could say ahh...this is a sign and not question its intent. This commonality could also be applied to colors, for ex. red to be read as alarming or stay alert, yellow being caution, etc.

<h5>Question 4</h5>
<p>Werner Reiterer is an amazing artist who does many artworks revolving around the idea of art interventions. This artist was definitely one of the first to come to mind if we were to talk about art that uses existing environments, especially because Werner is known for his effort to undermine and subvert our habits of perception. He doesn’t make pieces to confuse his audience but to rather fill them with a new configuration of content in regards to its location. For example, in Reiterer’s piece, <i>Street Chandelier</i> of 2012, he essentially challenges our already social and economical shaped habits in our behaviour of how we perceive street lights and chandeliers, one being in the streets and one being in a room/household. However, Reiterer mixes these notions to create a new way of thinking and he calls this art.
