<h5>Question 1</h5>
<p>Site specific art is art created in a specific local. Location is the primary focus of this type of art, where the work is united and in relationship with its environment. A bit differently, art interventions are works/art designed specifically in relation to an already existing environment, structure/domain, and/or audience. In other words, site specific is the notion of having a particular space in mind to display oneâ€™s work, while the other uses an existing venue.</p>
