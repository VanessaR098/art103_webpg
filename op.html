  <h3>"Flantastic", p5.js, 2020 (Art 101)</h3>
  <p> Many people take great comfort in desserts, after a fulfilling day, or even after a meal. It's always a pleasant item that everyone looks forward to no matter how tired, full, or worn out one may be. It creates happiness, comfort and
    satsifaction.

    This work for my Art 101 class was a way of capturing those forms and emotions of a delicate dessert. Flan just so happened to be my favorite, thus creating a work that portrayed my perspective of how a flan is to me. Delicately adorable, yet
    when
    taken a bite out of, it becomes delicately explosive with sharp caramel and burnt sugar while remaining sweet and milky. </p>

    <h3>Art Piece #2</h3>

    <h3>Wire Frame Flower, 2020 (Art 13)</h3>
    <p>The rose is given as a celebration of love, givingness, and remembrance. We pick them in hopes to preserve them, but the circle of life causes them to wilt. However, in that short span of time, the appearance of the rose brings us calm and
      happiness. Seeing it's physique and uniqueness through each pedal and each leaf, getting caught up in the focal point of it all. </p>

    <p>As a way to preserve a rose forever, it became my item of choice to build with wire. I chose to pay attention throught the expression of its composition and detail, trying to resemble a rose as much as possible. Having it all done by hand
      really
      adds to that special uniqueness a rose has. </p>

    <h3>Art Piece #3</h3>
    <img src="Images/vr_MentalAwareness.jpg" alt="Mental Awareness Project" class="center">
    <h3>"Piece of Mind", Installation, 2020 (Personal)</h3>

    <p> Anxiety is in the face of all life, through times that are uncertain and unpredictable, through times that are overwhelming. It creates a mystery and frustration with just living and being. We live to fulfill, to find, and to create a
      purpose,
      but the ludicrous, ridiculous pressure life and the world creates leave one in anxious question.
    </p>

    <p>My collection of pieces captures my intense anxiety during my daily life. I called this piece “Piece of Mind,” where each day I would draw 3 or more drawings based on my paranoia, each projecting a different feeling, emotion, anxiety, panic,
      etc. that I would feel throughout that day. My intention was to accumulate all of my drawings around a mirror in the center and completed the installation to resemble a detective/forensics wall. I wanted to create an experience of being trapped
      within one's self and then being surrounded by consistent, overwhelming emotions/thoughts that all connect back to you, the one who is trapped.</p>

    <p> This was a project I worked on as a way of coping through school, and transitioning into quarantine, and then coping with primarily being in my home environment. It was certainly a handful, but a handful I found peace in holding. It allowed
      to
      me to feel free with my emotions and to draw when I felt trapped and allowing that expression to paint itself onto paper. I would take my sketchbooks to me wherever I would go: on the bus, sitting in student union, studying in the library,
      eating
      lunch, relaxing at home/in my room, in classes, etc. I would quickly sketch how I was feeling, and by the end of the day come back to it to do line art and enhancements and rip it out and put it on my wall. The more the wall built up with
      images,
      the more it It allowed to see myself in a new way, how my brain functioned throughout the day, how my anxiety persisted consistently in everything I did, no matter where I was there was some sort of emotional explosion. </p>
