  <h1>Reading #3</h1>
  <h4>Q1. -- From the podcast, how has our understanding of what dinosaurs really look like evolved? Describe the progression of how we portrayed them and how might this affect our understanding of what Archeology is saying about them. <br>
    Q2. -- The artist/archaeologist John Conway who is doing interpretations of dinosaurs is obviously taking liberty with what could be the actual truth of how these creatures existed. What other disciplines and forms of studies use similar techniques that remind you of this method or process. Please elaborate with your examples both written as well as images and links.<br>
    Q3. -- First, summarize in your own words the characteristics of 'Material Speculation' as described in the second article. Next, given this article's shows examples for possible future products, how can this same technique also be used to create objects that refer to the past or current moment?</h4>


  <h5>Question 1</h5>
  <p>This question really brings an interesting correlation between different interpretations and how it affects others and our communities. As the podcast discusses, dinosaurs were originally perceived as dumb, wastes of space, souless, etc. and therefore how they were drawn and displayed reflected that interpretation. The interpretation is then shared to the public which then the public absorbs and spreads. Because these interpretations come from positions of expertise, the public does little to question its validity, and now creates a society where the majority believes they are correct with their insight. In this specific case, I believe this original interpretation creates a society of high ego, because it’s almost as if Archeology is telling us we triumph amongst other creatures. This becomes difficult to reverse when so heavily planted. However,Bakker strived to change this with a different perspective that in reality, dinosaurs are much more elegant and smart than many may have believed. Thus evolving our understanding of dinosaurs to now be seen as intelligent, aware, and conscious. </p>

  <h5>Question 2</h5>

  <p>Other forms of studies that use similar techniques is certainly the field of science, and how art portrays these theories and how it shapes our society. For ex. the discovery of a heliocentric solar system and how this sparked debate between scientists, the church, and the general public regarding geocentric (Earth as the center) vs heliocentric (Sun as the center). During the Renaissance Era, Copernicus shared a different view of the universe and how his research of the planet’s movements differed from the many scholars' geocentric theory. Copernicus’ heliocentric theory was evidently promising, however because the majority had different views, his theory was easily rejected. Pretty interesting again how the original geocentric theory also prompted egocentric values by placing “our” planet as the center and therefore, promoting our planet and species as superior. <br> <a href="https://www.librarypoint.org/blogs/post/early-astronomers/#:~:text=Well%20over%20a%20thousand%20years,the%20center%20of%20our%20system."> Source</a></p>

  <p>Another example is psychological studies of facial anatomy, specifically physiognomy, now classified as a pseudoscience because of its lack of evidence. This study believed that one could identify characteristics and traits by simply observing one’s facial structures/features. Aka the art of reading one’s personality in their face. For example, if one looked like an animal, say an owl, one would have characteristics like an owl. Some even believed that criminals could be distinguished through this method, by how closely they’d resemble apes, associated with savagery. As a result, artists would draw faces side by side with exaggerated animals to correlate these points thus forming the earliest form of caricature in human society. This information then creates a society influenced by the acceptance of judgement as well as indirectly and/or directly pushing people into characters that resemble their physiognomy, rather than letting them discover themselves. <br> <a href="https://www.wired.com/2015/01/fantastically-wrong-physiognomy/"> Source</a></p>

  <h5>Question 3</h5>
  <p>According to the article, I believe “Material Speculation” is the use of designed objects recognized in our daily lives that bring forth the question and exploration of whether its functionality is plausible in different environments, or as the article refers to as <i>possible worlds</i>. For example, the infinity gauntlet is appropriate in the Marvel Universe, but could be a ring holder in a different environment. One example I could think of is ancient egyptian hieroglyphics, but instead of hieroglyphs, it’s emoji-glyphs. An ancient text future generations will find impossible to crack.
