  <!-- Summary of Documentary Plot -->
  <p>In the year of 3057, advancement in technology makes a revolutionary turn in human advancement where one is able to measure the state and value of an individual's being. A team of the world's smartest scientists, P.U.R.I.T.A.N.S., came together to create technology that allowed, what they call, "Soul Vision."  Once regulated and approved by the government, P.U.R.I.T.A.N.S. strived to use this advancment to create harmony amongst their citizens. Their devices would measure the potential of souls that'd be regulated through government data, and if criminal potential increases, police would take proper action. But, some scientists disagreed with these principles and in opposition were turned away by the government. They formed their own group founded as Dhark in 3107, where they believed in complete eradication of bad/evil souls in order to create a completely pure society. After years of clashing principles, the first Soul War began 86 years later.  </p>

  <p>This is the modeled mask representative of the "P.U.R.I.T.A.N.S" from the 1st Soul Purge War of our <i>Soul Vision</i> universe. Their mask consists of rare soul stones that allow them to see the purity/impurity of individual's souls for long periods
    of time without visual damage. The mask sits directly on their eyes, snug on the front of their face. The P.U.R.I.T.A.N.S group is in search of souls that have been snatched by the "Dhark" Cult. </p>
